They are talking me about;
Travel is so much more than simply reaching your destination.
Along your journey, you will make an immediate impact on re-imagining travel by gleaning insightful recommendations

From collaborating with internal clients and influencing business decisions, to A/B testing hypotheses,
there is no shortage of opportunities for technical innovation at IT travel– the sky’s the limit!
Modernizing our Search Platform is a high-visibility and accelerated capability in the company.

we are a highly motivated individual to partner with the Search and Discovery team
and help build scalable products that optimize multiple objective functions catering to the traveler,
travel partners, and our mission.</P>
